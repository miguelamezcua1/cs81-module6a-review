## Reflection: Playlist Object Review

### What was the hardest part to understand?
The hardest part was remembering to use `this` correctly inside the methods. At first I kept forgetting that `this.songs` refers to the playlist's own song list. Once I got used to it, it made more sense how the object keeps track of its own data.

### How does this code use `this` to tie data and behavior together?
Each method uses `this` to connect to the playlist's specific properties like `songs`, `name`, or `currentSong`. That way, the same method works for any playlist without hardcoding values. It lets the behavior always act on the current object.

### What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?
I would probably add a method to shuffle the songs or jump to a specific one by index. Iâ€™d also make it so the playlist could show which song is playing with its position number. Right now it works, but it could be more interactive.
